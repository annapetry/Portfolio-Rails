        I’m a
        <span>developer</span>, a
        <span>designer</span>, and a
        <span>maker</span>. With a background in product design, graphic design, and web development, I’m in hot pursuit of a career at the intersection of the technical and the creative. Most recently, I’ve been building a solid foundation in
        <span>Ruby</span>,
        <span>Ruby on Rails</span>,
        <span>JavaScript</span>, and
        <span>Backbone.js</span>.

      <p class="description about">
        Located in San Francisco, I'm currently looking for web development opportunities. I'd prefer someplace a little funky, where people are proud of their work. If that sounds like someplace you know, get in touch!
